# Integrating a New `Task`

`Task`s can be broadly categorized into two types:

- "First-party" - where the analysis or executed code is maintained within this library.
- "Third-party" - where the analysis, code, or program is maintained elsewhere and is simply called by a wrapping `Task`.

Creating a new `Task` of either type generally involves the same steps, although for first-party `Task`s, the analysis code must of course also be written. Due to this difference, as well as additional considerations for parameter handling when dealing with "third-party" `Task`s, the "first-party" and "third-party" `Task` integration cases will be considered separately.
