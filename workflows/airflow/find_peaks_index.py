"""SFX Peak finding and indexing only.

Runs peak finding with psocake followed by CrystFEL indexing.

Note:
    The task_id MUST match the managed task name when defining DAGs - it is used
    by the operator to properly launch it.

    dag_id names must be unique, and they are not namespaced via folder
    hierarchy. I.e. all DAGs on an Airflow instance must have unique ids. The
    Airflow instance used by LUTE is currently shared by other software - DAG
    IDs should always be prefixed with `lute_`. LUTE scripts should append this
    internally, so a DAG "lute_test" can be triggered by asking for "test"
