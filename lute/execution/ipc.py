"""Classes and utilities for communication between Executors and subprocesses.

Communicators manage message passing and parsing between subprocesses. They
maintain a limited public interface of "read" and "write" operations. Behind
this interface the methods of communication vary from serialization across
pipes to Unix sockets, etc. All communicators pass a single object called a
"Message" which contains an arbitrary "contents" field as well as an optional
"signal" field.


Classes:
    Party: Enum describing whether Communicator is on Task-side or Executor-side.

    Message: A dataclass used for passing information from Task to Executor.

    Communicator: Abstract base class for Communicator types.

    PipeCommunicator: Manages communication between Task and Executor via pipes
        (stderr and stdout).

    SocketCommunicator: Manages communication using sockets, either raw or using
        zmq. Supports both TCP and Unix sockets.

        only two-way splits. If there are more complex arrangements such as:

        The simpler two way splits are unlikely to occur in normal usage. They
        may arise when debugging if, e.g., `print` statements are mixed with the
        usage of the `_report_to_executor` method.

class SocketCommunicator(Communicator):
    """Provides communication over Unix or TCP sockets.

    Communication is provided either using sockets with the Python socket library
    or using ZMQ. The choice of implementation is controlled by the global bool
    `USE_ZMQ`.

    Whether to use TCP or Unix sockets is controlled by the environment:
                           `LUTE_USE_TCP=1`
    If defined, TCP sockets will be used, otherwise Unix sockets will be used.

    Regardless of socket type, the environment variable
                      `LUTE_EXECUTOR_HOST=<hostname>`
    will be defined by the Executor-side Communicator.


    For TCP sockets:
    The Executor-side Communicator should be run first and will bind to all
    interfaces on the port determined by the environment variable:
                            `LUTE_PORT=###`
    If no port is defined, a port scan will be performed and the Executor-side
    Communicator will bind the first one available from a random selection. It
    will then define the environment variable so the Task-side can pick it up.

    For Unix sockets:
    The path to the Unix socket is defined by the environment variable:
                      `LUTE_SOCKET=/path/to/socket`
    This class assumes proper permissions and that this above environment
    variable has been defined. The `Task` is configured as what would commonly
    be referred to as the `client`, while the `Executor` is configured as the
    server.

    If the Task process is run on a different machine than the Executor, the
    Task-side Communicator will open a ssh-tunnel to forward traffic from a local
    Unix socket to the Executor Unix socket. Opening of the tunnel relies on the
    environment variable:
                      `LUTE_EXECUTOR_HOST=<hostname>`
    to determine the Executor's host. This variable should be defined by the
    Executor and passed to the Task process automatically, but it can also be
    defined manually if launching the Task process separately. The Task will use
    the local socket `<LUTE_SOCKET>.task{##}`. Multiple local sockets may be
    created. Currently, it is assumed that the user is identical on both the Task
    machine and Executor machine.
