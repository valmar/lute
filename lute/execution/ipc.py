"""Classes and utilities for communication between Executors and subprocesses.

Communicators manage message passing and parsing between subprocesses. They
maintain a limited public interface of "read" and "write" operations. Behind
this interface the methods of communication vary from serialization across
pipes to Unix sockets, etc. All communicators pass a single object called a
"Message" which contains an arbitrary "contents" field as well as an optional
"signal" field.

        It attempts to handle cases where contents can be mixed, i.e., part of

        only two-way splits. If there are more complex arrangements such as:
        <pickled>:<unpickled>:<pickled> etc, it will give up.

        The simpler two way splits are unlikely to occur in normal usage. They
        may arise when debugging if, e.g., `print` statements are mixed with the
        usage of the `_report_to_executor` method.

        Note that this method works because ONLY text data is assumed to be
        sent via the pipes. The method needs to be revised to handle non-text
        data if the `Task` is modified to also send that via PipeCommunicator.
        The use of pickle is supported to provide for this option if it is
        necessary. It may be deprecated in the future.

        Be careful when making changes. This method has seemingly redundant
        checks because unpickling will not throw an error if a full object can
        be retrieved. That is, the library will ignore extraneous bytes. This
